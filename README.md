# IsmaelClass
Really really simple console framework, school projects helper, in this project you can find some classes
that will help you to run some simple menu programs, also  dinamic menus that just take the name and run.
you will find a sort of "root" explorer, that lets you read, and write some variables, even if they are private
for that uses the Reflection API.


As i said, this is a school project, i´ve been working on this since i entered the university, i´m very proud of what i´ve done
just reading and asking my profesors how to do this and that, feel free to use it if you find it useful, if you want to make 
some changes for you, link this repo.
